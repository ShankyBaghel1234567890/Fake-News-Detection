You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

Over 80% of Americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped. But what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated America? The answers I found may surprise you!In California, if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico, it would leave an extra $10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupt hospitals and overrun prisons. It would leave highways cleaner, safer and less congested. Everyone could understand one another as English became the dominant language again.In Colorado, 500,000 illegal migrants, plus their 300,000 kids and grandchilds would move back  home,  mostly to Mexico. That would save Colorado an estimated $2 billion (other experts say $7 billion) annually in taxes that pay for schooling, medical, social-services and incarceration costs. It means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of Denver alone.Colorado would save more than $20 million in prison costs, and the terror that those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens. Denver Officer Don Young and hundreds of Colorado victims would not have suffered death, accidents, rapes and other crimes by illegals.Denver Public Schools would not suffer a 67% dropout/flunk rate because of thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages. At least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from our gridlocked cities in Colorado. Denver s 4% unem ployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage.In Florida, 1.5 million illegals would return the Sunshine State back to America, the rule of law, and English.In Chicago, Illinois, 2.1 million illegals would free up hospitals, schools, prisons and highways for a safer, cleaner and more crime-free experience.If 20 million illegal aliens returned  home,  the U.S. Economy would return to the rule of law. Employers would hire legal American citizens at a living wage. Everyone would pay their fair share of taxes because they wouldn t be working off the books. That would result in an additional $401 billion in IRS income taxes collected annually, and an equal amount for local, state and city coffers.No more push  1  for Spanish or  2  for English. No more confusion in American schools that now must contend with over 100 languages that degrade the educational system for American kids. Our overcrowded schools would lose more than two million illegal alien kids at a cost of billions in ESL and free breakfasts and lunches.We would lose 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually. That includes 15,000 MS-13 gang members who distribute $130 billion in drugs annually would vacate our country.In cities like L.A., 20,000 members of the  18th Street Gang  would vanish from our nation. No more Mexican forgery gangs for ID theft from Americans! No more foreign rapists and child molesters!Losing more than 20 million people would clear up our crowded highways and gridlock. Cleaner air and less drinking and driving American deaths by illegal aliens!   Author unknownThis article was sent to us by a 100% FED UP follower. While we cannot verify the facts and figures in this article, we thought it was worth sharing, as the basic premise of how Americans would benefit by 20 million illegals leaving America holds true. Illegal Alien Crimes Committed In U.S.A. Statistics:CIS  ICE continued to release deportable criminal aliens from its custody at an alarming rate in 2015, according to figures the agency provided to members of Congress this week in advance of a hearing taking place Thursday, April 28. In 2015, ICE freed 19,723 criminal aliens, who had a total of 64,197 convictions among them. These included 8,234 violent convictions and 208 homicide convictions. While the total number of releases is lower than the past two years, since the number of arrests has declined quite dramatically, the rate of releases is approximately the same   meaning that this is no progress at all, and certainly will be no consolation for the victims of these criminal aliens.The table below enumerates the criminal convictions associated with the released aliens. The largest number of convictions was for Driving Under the Influence; there were 12,307 alcohol DUI convictions and 354 drug DUI convictions, for a total of 12,661.Convictions for Alien Criminals Released Convictions Number of Convictions Traffic Offense: Driving Under the Influence, Liquor 12,307 Traffic Offense 9,811 Dangerous Drugs 7,986 Larceny 3,535 Immigration 3,064 Obstructing Judiciary/Congress/Legislature,etc. 2,561 General Crimes 2,008 Burglary 1,963 Fraudulent Activities 1,880 Assault 1,728 Public Peace 1,659 Obstructing the Police 1,420 Assault-Domestic Violence 1,347 Weapon Offenses 1,317 Invasion of Privacy 1,012 Assault- Aggravated Assault 921 Assault- Battery 912 Forgery 840 Robbery 804 Stolen Vehicle 782 Family Offenses 763 Stolen Property 761 Sex Offences (not involving Assault or Commercialized Sex) 614 Damage Property 552 Traffic Offense- Hit and Run 394 Liquor 363 Health/Safety 361 Traffic Offenses- Driving Under Influence of Drugs 354 Commercialized Sexual Offenses 352 Sexual Assault 320 Assault- Simple Assault 229 Kidnapping 216 Flight/Escape 214 Threat 134 Homicide 101 Assault- Intimidation 98 Conservation 72 Gambling 56 Embezzlement 50 Arson 41 Tax Revenue 40 Extortion 36 Juvenile Offenders 35 Obscenity 32 Smuggling 28 Homicide- Negligent Manslaughter- Weapon 19 Homicide- Negligent Manslaughter- Vehicle 19 Homicide- Willful Kill- Weapon 19 Homicide- Willful Kill- Gun 18 Bribery 13 Voluntary- Manslaughter 12 Homicide- Willful Kill- Non-family-Gun 9 Homidice- Willful Kill- Non-family- Weapon 4 Traffic Offense- Transporting Dangerous Material 4 Homicide- Willful Kill- Family- Weapon 3 Homicide- Attempt to Commit 2 Homicide- John/Jane Doe- No Warrant 1Total 64,197\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government plan to offer free higher education for students from poor and working class households will be implemented in a  fiscally sustainable manner , President Jacob Zuma said on Saturday. Following a recommendation by a commission on higher education funding, Zuma said the government will increase subsidies to universities to 1 percent of gross domestic product over the next five years from nearly 0.7 percent at present.  \",\n          \"LONDON (Reuters) - Theresa May appointed a strong Brexit supporter as aid minister on Thursday following a resignation that left the British prime minister struggling to ward off open conflict in a cabinet divided over leaving the European Union. May is grappling with crises on several fronts. Her team is struggling to make headway in exit talks with the EU, several ministers are embroiled in a wider sexual harassment scandal and her ability to command a majority in parliament is facing its most serious test.  Penny Mordaunt, 44, who has previously held junior ministerial roles, had a short meeting with May at Downing Street during which her appointment as the new International Development Secretary was confirmed. Fellow Brexit supporter Priti Patel resigned from the position on Wednesday over undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials that breached diplomatic protocol. Patel s resignation forced May into her second cabinet reshuffle in a week after Michael Fallon resigned as defense secretary in the sexual harassment scandal. Two other ministers, including May s deputy, are also being investigated.  Although May and her cabinet are united in their intention to take Britain out of the EU, her ministerial team is seen as a delicate balancing act between lawmakers who are still identified as  remainers  or  leavers  according to how they voted in the referendum.  Leaving aside Penny Mordaunt s qualifications for the job, the main one is obviously that she s a Brexiteer. It doesn t seem now that any appointment can be made in this government other than on the basis of whether that person supported  leave  or  remain ,  said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London.  That is indicative of the difficult position that Theresa May is in and you ve got to ask whether that is good for the country.  Mordaunt campaigned for the  Vote Leave  group during the EU referendum, and was criticized by then-prime minister David Cameron for inaccurately saying that Britain would not be able to stop Turkey from joining the EU if it remained a member. All EU states have veto powers on new members. The former junior defense minister was elected in 2010 to represent the southern English coastal city of Portsmouth, where she also serves as a volunteer reservist for the Royal Navy.  In the early 1990s she worked in hospitals and orphanages in Romania, and recently spoke about the  medieval  conditions she witnessed there. Until Thursday s appointment, Mordaunt held a junior ministerial post with responsibilities for disabled people, health and work within the Department of Work and Pensions. The instability in May s top team adds to what is already a difficult political situation.  An ill-judged snap election in June cost her party its majority in parliament and has sapped her authority at a time when she is trying to heal deep divisions within her own party and negotiate Britain s departure from the EU. The European Parliament s Brexit negotiator doused hopes that those negotiations were nearing a breakthrough, saying   major issues  must still be resolved on safeguarding citizens  rights. A fresh round of negotiations between Britain and the European Commission began on Thursday. Progress in Brussels is vital to help May keep onside nervous businesses who say they urgently need to know what will happen when Britain leaves the bloc; otherwise they will be forced to start triggering contingency plans. On Wednesday, EU envoys discussed delaying the launch of talks with London on a post-Brexit relationship to next year. Sixteen months after Britain narrowly voted to leave the EU in a referendum, opinions are still split over Brexit at every level from voter to minister. In replacing Patel, an outspoken leaver, with another Brexiteer, May looked to maintain her senior team s balance. The promotion of a junior minister could also help placate younger members of the party, many of whom are angry at her mishandling of the snap election campaign and feel they should be given a chance to regenerate the party s support. Failure to satisfy the party is seen as a risk to May s future as leader. She is reliant on uniting all her lawmakers to pass legislation, including the laws needed to enact Brexit which will be up for debate in parliament next week. If she is unable to prove her ability to pass legislation and govern effectively, the Conservative party - historically intolerant of weakened leaders - could seek to replace her, although there are currently no clear candidates to do so. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news=news.reset_index(drop=True)\n","news.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"3PaOv6YoBmTY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741361063319,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1688,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"3863e8ed-3e92-489e-d732-eb1b5c5f873b"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label\n","0  https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/79389017105...      1\n","1  It s been two months since the 2016 Election t...      1\n","2  HERE S WHAT MCCAIN SAID THAT GOT RAND PAUL ALL...      1\n","3  While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state ...      1\n","4  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said hig...      0"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-9304123c-a1ed-44ff-a133-e9b795efeda3\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/79389017105...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>It s been two months since the 2016 Election t...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>HERE S WHAT MCCAIN SAID THAT GOT RAND PAUL ALL...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state ...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said hig...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-9304123c-a1ed-44ff-a133-e9b795efeda3')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-9304123c-a1ed-44ff-a133-e9b795efeda3 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Over 80% of Americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped. But what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated America? The answers I found may surprise you!In California, if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico, it would leave an extra $10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupt hospitals and overrun prisons. It would leave highways cleaner, safer and less congested. Everyone could understand one another as English became the dominant language again.In Colorado, 500,000 illegal migrants, plus their 300,000 kids and grandchilds would move back  home,  mostly to Mexico. That would save Colorado an estimated $2 billion (other experts say $7 billion) annually in taxes that pay for schooling, medical, social-services and incarceration costs. It means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of Denver alone.Colorado would save more than $20 million in prison costs, and the terror that those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens. Denver Officer Don Young and hundreds of Colorado victims would not have suffered death, accidents, rapes and other crimes by illegals.Denver Public Schools would not suffer a 67% dropout/flunk rate because of thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages. At least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from our gridlocked cities in Colorado. Denver s 4% unem ployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage.In Florida, 1.5 million illegals would return the Sunshine State back to America, the rule of law, and English.In Chicago, Illinois, 2.1 million illegals would free up hospitals, schools, prisons and highways for a safer, cleaner and more crime-free experience.If 20 million illegal aliens returned  home,  the U.S. Economy would return to the rule of law. Employers would hire legal American citizens at a living wage. Everyone would pay their fair share of taxes because they wouldn t be working off the books. That would result in an additional $401 billion in IRS income taxes collected annually, and an equal amount for local, state and city coffers.No more push  1  for Spanish or  2  for English. No more confusion in American schools that now must contend with over 100 languages that degrade the educational system for American kids. Our overcrowded schools would lose more than two million illegal alien kids at a cost of billions in ESL and free breakfasts and lunches.We would lose 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually. That includes 15,000 MS-13 gang members who distribute $130 billion in drugs annually would vacate our country.In cities like L.A., 20,000 members of the  18th Street Gang  would vanish from our nation. No more Mexican forgery gangs for ID theft from Americans! No more foreign rapists and child molesters!Losing more than 20 million people would clear up our crowded highways and gridlock. Cleaner air and less drinking and driving American deaths by illegal aliens!   Author unknownThis article was sent to us by a 100% FED UP follower. While we cannot verify the facts and figures in this article, we thought it was worth sharing, as the basic premise of how Americans would benefit by 20 million illegals leaving America holds true. Illegal Alien Crimes Committed In U.S.A. Statistics:CIS  ICE continued to release deportable criminal aliens from its custody at an alarming rate in 2015, according to figures the agency provided to members of Congress this week in advance of a hearing taking place Thursday, April 28. In 2015, ICE freed 19,723 criminal aliens, who had a total of 64,197 convictions among them. These included 8,234 violent convictions and 208 homicide convictions. While the total number of releases is lower than the past two years, since the number of arrests has declined quite dramatically, the rate of releases is approximately the same   meaning that this is no progress at all, and certainly will be no consolation for the victims of these criminal aliens.The table below enumerates the criminal convictions associated with the released aliens. The largest number of convictions was for Driving Under the Influence; there were 12,307 alcohol DUI convictions and 354 drug DUI convictions, for a total of 12,661.Convictions for Alien Criminals Released Convictions Number of Convictions Traffic Offense: Driving Under the Influence, Liquor 12,307 Traffic Offense 9,811 Dangerous Drugs 7,986 Larceny 3,535 Immigration 3,064 Obstructing Judiciary/Congress/Legislature,etc. 2,561 General Crimes 2,008 Burglary 1,963 Fraudulent Activities 1,880 Assault 1,728 Public Peace 1,659 Obstructing the Police 1,420 Assault-Domestic Violence 1,347 Weapon Offenses 1,317 Invasion of Privacy 1,012 Assault- Aggravated Assault 921 Assault- Battery 912 Forgery 840 Robbery 804 Stolen Vehicle 782 Family Offenses 763 Stolen Property 761 Sex Offences (not involving Assault or Commercialized Sex) 614 Damage Property 552 Traffic Offense- Hit and Run 394 Liquor 363 Health/Safety 361 Traffic Offenses- Driving Under Influence of Drugs 354 Commercialized Sexual Offenses 352 Sexual Assault 320 Assault- Simple Assault 229 Kidnapping 216 Flight/Escape 214 Threat 134 Homicide 101 Assault- Intimidation 98 Conservation 72 Gambling 56 Embezzlement 50 Arson 41 Tax Revenue 40 Extortion 36 Juvenile Offenders 35 Obscenity 32 Smuggling 28 Homicide- Negligent Manslaughter- Weapon 19 Homicide- Negligent Manslaughter- Vehicle 19 Homicide- Willful Kill- Weapon 19 Homicide- Willful Kill- Gun 18 Bribery 13 Voluntary- Manslaughter 12 Homicide- Willful Kill- Non-family-Gun 9 Homidice- Willful Kill- Non-family- Weapon 4 Traffic Offense- Transporting Dangerous Material 4 Homicide- Willful Kill- Family- Weapon 3 Homicide- Attempt to Commit 2 Homicide- John/Jane Doe- No Warrant 1Total 64,197\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government plan to offer free higher education for students from poor and working class households will be implemented in a  fiscally sustainable manner , President Jacob Zuma said on Saturday. Following a recommendation by a commission on higher education funding, Zuma said the government will increase subsidies to universities to 1 percent of gross domestic product over the next five years from nearly 0.7 percent at present.  \",\n          \"LONDON (Reuters) - Theresa May appointed a strong Brexit supporter as aid minister on Thursday following a resignation that left the British prime minister struggling to ward off open conflict in a cabinet divided over leaving the European Union. May is grappling with crises on several fronts. Her team is struggling to make headway in exit talks with the EU, several ministers are embroiled in a wider sexual harassment scandal and her ability to command a majority in parliament is facing its most serious test.  Penny Mordaunt, 44, who has previously held junior ministerial roles, had a short meeting with May at Downing Street during which her appointment as the new International Development Secretary was confirmed. Fellow Brexit supporter Priti Patel resigned from the position on Wednesday over undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials that breached diplomatic protocol. Patel s resignation forced May into her second cabinet reshuffle in a week after Michael Fallon resigned as defense secretary in the sexual harassment scandal. Two other ministers, including May s deputy, are also being investigated.  Although May and her cabinet are united in their intention to take Britain out of the EU, her ministerial team is seen as a delicate balancing act between lawmakers who are still identified as  remainers  or  leavers  according to how they voted in the referendum.  Leaving aside Penny Mordaunt s qualifications for the job, the main one is obviously that she s a Brexiteer. It doesn t seem now that any appointment can be made in this government other than on the basis of whether that person supported  leave  or  remain ,  said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London.  That is indicative of the difficult position that Theresa May is in and you ve got to ask whether that is good for the country.  Mordaunt campaigned for the  Vote Leave  group during the EU referendum, and was criticized by then-prime minister David Cameron for inaccurately saying that Britain would not be able to stop Turkey from joining the EU if it remained a member. All EU states have veto powers on new members. The former junior defense minister was elected in 2010 to represent the southern English coastal city of Portsmouth, where she also serves as a volunteer reservist for the Royal Navy.  In the early 1990s she worked in hospitals and orphanages in Romania, and recently spoke about the  medieval  conditions she witnessed there. Until Thursday s appointment, Mordaunt held a junior ministerial post with responsibilities for disabled people, health and work within the Department of Work and Pensions. The instability in May s top team adds to what is already a difficult political situation.  An ill-judged snap election in June cost her party its majority in parliament and has sapped her authority at a time when she is trying to heal deep divisions within her own party and negotiate Britain s departure from the EU. The European Parliament s Brexit negotiator doused hopes that those negotiations were nearing a breakthrough, saying   major issues  must still be resolved on safeguarding citizens  rights. A fresh round of negotiations between Britain and the European Commission began on Thursday. Progress in Brussels is vital to help May keep onside nervous businesses who say they urgently need to know what will happen when Britain leaves the bloc; otherwise they will be forced to start triggering contingency plans. On Wednesday, EU envoys discussed delaying the launch of talks with London on a post-Brexit relationship to next year. Sixteen months after Britain narrowly voted to leave the EU in a referendum, opinions are still split over Brexit at every level from voter to minister. In replacing Patel, an outspoken leaver, with another Brexiteer, May looked to maintain her senior team s balance. The promotion of a junior minister could also help placate younger members of the party, many of whom are angry at her mishandling of the snap election campaign and feel they should be given a chance to regenerate the party s support. Failure to satisfy the party is seen as a risk to May s future as leader. She is reliant on uniting all her lawmakers to pass legislation, including the laws needed to enact Brexit which will be up for debate in parliament next week. If she is unable to prove her ability to pass legislation and govern effectively, the Conservative party - historically intolerant of weakened leaders - could seek to replace her, although there are currently no clear candidates to do so. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years, will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said. On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.\"\"\"\n","tempnews2 = \"\"\"In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his friends were calling to say he looked like a fool after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a terrorist haven, the people of Nigeria would never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the American Carnage speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"l6Irnh27YO7a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741365486907,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}}},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["manual_testing(tempnews)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QyT7S_jJbUK7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741365489747,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":317,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"e2d497e0-4094-491c-b71f-d81458d007f7"},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\\LR Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","NB Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","RFC Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","DTC Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","KNC Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","GBC Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","XGBC Prediction: Not A Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["manual_testing(tempnews2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9Wb5WiiecT8e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741365492792,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"9944ed98-9152-45fb-f60e-a6a25b7cd10b"},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\\LR Prediction: Fake News \n","NB Prediction: Fake News \n","RFC Prediction: Fake News \n","DTC Prediction: Fake News \n","KNC Prediction: Fake News \n","GBC Prediction: Fake News \n","XGBC Prediction: Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Save and Load Model"],"metadata":{"id":"VfiT__xBflxE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import joblib\n","\n","# Assuming you have already fitted the TF-IDF vectorizer\n","joblib.dump(vectorization, \"vectorizer.pkl\")\n","\n","print(\"Vectorizer saved successfully!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qCLqbovkktjs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741367226177,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1065,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"baf7637b-1a32-462c-ea90-b54ffdbea935"},"execution_count":56,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vectorizer saved successfully!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load the saved vectorizer\n","vectorizer = joblib.load(\"vectorizer.pkl\")\n","\n","print(\"Vectorizer loaded successfully!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"yFsQsXSnkzyF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741367247806,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1044,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"26dfbebd-e24b-410b-8ba2-506c40f9e345"},"execution_count":57,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vectorizer loaded successfully!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import joblib\n","\n","# Save the trained model\n","joblib.dump(model, \"fake_news_detector.pkl\")\n","\n","print(\"Model saved successfully!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0Mfbiba5fqi6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741365912420,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":143,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"84e2ab2a-c7ff-4c07-c1e5-a903e0e9284e"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Model saved successfully!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load the model\n","loaded_model = joblib.load(\"fake_news_detector.pkl\")\n","\n","print(\"Model loaded successfully!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_yuywaT0fz_l","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741365968441,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":61,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"29918b67-351b-4204-bae8-cea1bc5aaf44"},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Model loaded successfully!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example new input text\n","new_text = [\"AI system detects early signs of cancer\"]\n","\n","# Convert text to features (use the same vectorizer used during training)\n","new_text_tfidf = vectorization.transform(new_text).toarray()\n","\n","# Predict using the loaded model\n","prediction = loaded_model.predict(new_text_tfidf)\n","\n","# Check result\n","print(\"Fake News\" if prediction[0] == 1 else \"Real News\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XNQeipd5gA_K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741366332982,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":58,"user":{"displayName":"Shashank Singh","userId":"07569615571717516174"}},"outputId":"880118bd-465c-4e3c-b016-4039555b2c77"},"execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Fake News\n"]}]}]}
